Hi, i’m @ctr-alt-f3. I am 15 yo. I’m interested in low level programming, and reverse engineering.
I'm currently working on private and secure way to send data, check it out [here](https://github.com/ctr-alt-f3/PrivCommunication)
I'm still learning C, but i am doing my best.


All code here isn't ment to work. I just take fun from coding. Everything is easly compiled thru gcc. Only linux software, windows is bloat.
